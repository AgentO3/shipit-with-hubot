The ShipIt With Hubot
====================

At VividCortex we believe in getting code into production early and often. At the center of our deployment strategy is our Hubot 'Thing'. Through the power of ChatOps Thing empowers everyone in the company with the ability to ship code when they are ready. In this talk I will discuss what ChatOps is and we use it to continuously deliver code to production. I will give you a gentle intoduction to the Hubot API. Then finally I will wrap it up by going over some of the other useful and sometimes absurd Hubot commands we use VividCortex.
